# gee
gee is created for GEE learning and use,especially in the fields of geodata analysis,remote sensing data processing,big scale landscape PROTECTION,RESEARCH & DESIGN.
gee is not a big collection for GEE,but a small collection for myself and other learners who want to get or dominate some resources to it.
I will do my best to make gee better.
